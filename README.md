Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, I developed an intelligent agent capable of navigating a maze to locate a treasure, using reinforcement 
learning techniques—specifically, deep Q-learning with a neural network. I was provided with some initial setup code, which 
included the basic environment for the maze and the framework to simulate the agent’s actions and rewards. My primary 
contribution was designing and implementing the deep Q-learning algorithm.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

This project focused on AI and machine learning. Computer scientists are people who design and enact algorithms
that help computers solve problems and automate tasks for people. These algorithms can solve problems
quickly and efficiently. Reinforcement learning allows these machines to learn from their environment.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, problem-solving involves breaking down the challenge into manageable steps and selecting the
best algorithms and data structures. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities include ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and transparency of the systems I develop. 
Computer scientists must prioritize user safety, data privacy, and organizational integrity. Protecting privacy of the users
ensures trust. Making sure that authentication is done on the server side is important to protect information as well.
